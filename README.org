* Prerequisites
You must have Emacs 25 or greater installed on your system. Tested with emacs-plus from Homebrew


* Installation
Clone this repository using the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:conornash/dot-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC


Once the clone has completed successfully, run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacs --batch --eval '(require (quote org))' \
        --eval '(require (quote ob))' \
        --eval '(org-babel-load-file  (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/init.org"))'
#+END_SRC


This will download all required packages for Emacs. The first time you run Emacs, use:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emacs --debug-init

#+END_SRC

This will tell you what issues are present in your install.
